# CalcEcho500

# Why I made this project and how it works:

Me and my friend were thinking about exploring different places and we thought it'd be a good idea for us to have a way to communicate without having to use the internet or wifi, since being outdoors exploring usually means not being anywhere near cell towers. Hence the idea for the CalcEcho500.

The project is at its core a walkie talkie built inside a calculator, *insert materials used and why you are using them*
